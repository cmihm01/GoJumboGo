#GoJumboGo! 

This project is a game prototype designed to begin teaching children concepts of programming, such as 
sequencing, debugging, and algorithm design. It was built using Phaser in collaboration with Katie Hoskins
and Jenny Duong.


##Problem statement: We need a tool to introduce young children to simple coding concepts in a fun and accessible way through a game. 


##How do you solve the problem?
We will build an application in which users guide an animated elephant through a series of mazes by arranging action blocks. Action blocks will either be direction blocks, repeat blocks, or conditional blocks. Blocks can be arranged by clicking on them and dragging them into an ordered list on the screen. Direction blocks are associated with a direction -- up, down, left, right. Repeat blocks can be used to repeat an individual or a series of blocks. Conditional blocks can be used to sense things in the environment and act in a particular way based on the result. 
This teaches basic coding concepts by introducing users to the computational thinking mindset. By sequencing blocks, users begin to understand control-flow. Conditional blocks and repeat blocks are introductory to if statements and loops used in higher-level coding languages.
