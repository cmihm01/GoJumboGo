Accomplished:
	We accomplished the majority of our goals. We created a game homepage, with
	a few tabs, set up with bootstrap. The login page allows users to login with
	a google account, using the google API. 

	Action blocks were created, and they are fully functional. They return to
	their location if not dragged to the right area, and replace themselves
	if they end up in the list. Also, a "Go" button was added, which, when
	clicked, executes the actions specified in the blocks in the proper order. 
	There is also a reset button, which clears the direction array, and 
	returns blocks to their original location. 

Challenges:
	In terms of the action blocks, we struggled to understand how the 
	update function interacted with the larger program, because our elephant
	was not moving. This was resolved. Trying to figure out the best way to 
	store the buttons was also a challenge, as there are several forms they take.

	Bootstrap CSS is also difficult to work with, because we had to manually override.

Goals:
	We are currently working on launching the app on Heroku, so hopefully this
	will be working soon. Once Jumbo completes a maze, we want to implement an
	email option to send scores and other information. We also need to work on 
	logout options.
